							Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was introduced in September 1999
							as a part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard. The purpose
							of WEP was to provide data confidentiality similar to existing
							wired networks.

							<h3>WEP-x origins</h3>

							The original standard was WEP-40; due to US government export
							restrictions on cryptographic technology, the key size
							was limited to 40-bits in the standard 64-bit WEP. In 2000, the
							US government export restrictions were lifted and WEP-104, a
							128-bit system, was introduced by hardware manufacturers.

							<h3> Superceding of WEP </h3>
							In 2003, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superceded
							by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). In 2004, IEEE 802.11i introduced
							WPA2 and deprecated both WEP-40 and WEP-104, stating that they
							"fail to meet their security goals."

							<p>There are several attack vectors for WEP. Because it is based
							on an RC4 stream cipher, the same traffic key cannot be reused
							securely. The cipher is seeded with an IV--transmitted as plain
							text--which is only 24 bits in the most common variation of WEP:
							not enough to be secure on a busy network. For a 24-bit IV, there
							is a 50 percent probability of repetition after only 5000 packets
							due to the birthday principle. The way the IV is utilized also
							opens WEP up to a related key attack, where a mathematical
							relationship between keys can be known to the attacker.

							<p>Other major issues include that the use of WEP is optional on
							most routers, so many installations don't even bother using it
							at all. Even if it is being used, the default implementation of
							WEP uses a single shared key among users which leads to issues
							dealing with compromises. Often compromises aren't dealt with at all.

							<p>Most attacks deal with issues due to the RC4 stream cipher utilization
							technique, but Bittau, Handley, and Lackey showed in 2006 that
							the 802.11 protocol can be used to enable attacks against WEP
							that weren't thought previously possible. Only a single packet
							needs to be eavesdropped before bootstrapping to arbitrary data.

							<h3>RC4 based exploits</h3>
							<p>Most exploits are based on the RC4 stream itself. Fluhrer,
							Mantin and Shamir (FMS) found correlations between the RC4
							keystream, IV, and shared key allowing a passive, eavesdropping
							based attack to recover the RC4 key. Depending on the
							amount of traffic on the network successful key recovery can
							take only a minute or so. A key element of this attack strategy
							is to stimulate the server by injecting packets, causing more
							traffic to be available to monitor them. This attack can be
							done easily with consumer hardware.

							<p>Improvements to FMS were made by Andreas Klein in 2005, showing
							that there are additional correlations in the RC4 stream cipher
							than FMS had found previously. This increases the ease of cracking
							the cipher.

							<p>Klein's attack was improved by Tews, Pychkine and Weinmann (TPW)
							in 2007, extending the capability of this attack method. The
							new implementation allows recovering a WEP-104 key with a
							high probability of 50% with only 40,000 packets, reaching
							95% probability with only 95,000 packets.
